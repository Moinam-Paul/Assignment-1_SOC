# Assignment-1_SOC
## Description
This project focuses on scraping the details of last year's Season of Code's(SoC) title, name of mentors, no. of mentees and the link to each project and encapsulating them in a single Excel(xlsx) File. We were required to use libraries like BeautifulSoup, Requests and Pandas. Assignment-1.xlsx contains the all of the details in an Excel file, and Assignment-1.ipynb encompasses the associated code. Since, I was facing a lot of bad gateway, even with VPN, our mentor provided us with another link for the website:-
